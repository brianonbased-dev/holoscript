# HoloScript AI Use Cases

> **Note:** Detailed AI integration patterns and multi-agent protocols have been moved to the proprietary AI_Workspace.  
> See: `AI_Workspace/Projects/HoloScript/research/AI_USE_CASES.md`

## Overview

HoloScript is designed for AI-human collaboration through spatial programming patterns.

## Key Capabilities

### AI Reading HoloScript
- Parse `.holo` files to understand scene structure
- Extract object relationships and spatial data
- Analyze event triggers and logic flows

### AI Generating HoloScript
- Natural language to `.holo` conversion
- Voice command modifications
- Template-based generation

### AI Debugging
- Visual error detection
- Performance profiling
- Spatial issue highlighting

### AI Collaboration
- Multi-agent scene editing
- Agent communication protocols
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Integration Points

- **REST API**: Standard HTTP endpoints for AI services
- **Local LLM**: Privacy-focused offline inference
- **MCP Tools**: Model Context Protocol integration

## Best Practices

1. Preserve spatial semantics in AI generations
2. Use templates for reusable patterns
3. Annotate AI-generated code with metadata
4. Validate spatial correctness of generated content
5. Implement sandboxing for security
