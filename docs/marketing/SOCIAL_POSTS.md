## Full Threads

### Thread 1: "I built an open-source language that makes VR as easy as HTML"

1/ VR dev used to drive me up the wall. Clunky tools, endless boilerplate, and debugging in 3D? Nightmare. So I built HoloScript — an open-source language to make VR dev as simple as writing HTML.

2/ With HoloScript, you write VR scenes in a .holo file. A red box floating in space? Just describe it. No 100-line setup, just declarative magic. [ATTACH: code screenshot]

3/ Compare that to Unity or Three.js. Dozens of lines to init a scene, create a mesh, set materials. HoloScript cuts the cruft. Want a VR world? Describe it, done.

4/ HoloScript has 56 built-in traits. @grabbable makes stuff pickable. @physics adds gravity. @teleport lets you jump around. Mix and match to build wild experiences in minutes. [ATTACH: demo video]

5/ I've poured my heart into this to make VR accessible for builders like me. It's open-source — try a demo, star the repo, and let's make VR dev suck less together. #VRDev #WebXR

### Thread 2: "VR doesn't have to be hard. Here's proof."

1/ Think VR is just for hardcore coders? Nah. With HoloScript, teachers and students build VR experiences in 5 minutes. No installs, no PhD required.

2/ Our beginner tutorial: open a browser, load the editor, type a few lines, hit run. Boom — 3D world. Add @spinning to make it rotate. Kids get this instantly. [ATTACH: tutorial video]

3/ What newbies have built: a virtual art gallery with hover labels, a physics playground with bouncing objects. It's LEGO for VR — snap ideas together without sweating code. [ATTACH: screenshots]

4/ Best part? Runs in ANY browser via WebXR. No downloads, no beefy PC. Grab a headset or just use mouse/keyboard on your laptop. VR for everyone, everywhere.

5/ Know a teacher or student who'd love this? Share HoloScript with them. Let's get more folks creating in 3D. #VR #EdTech

### Thread 3: "The future of VR is declarative, not imperative"

1/ Hot take: VR dev is stuck in the past with imperative coding. We don't need 100s of lines to script every little thing. HoloScript flips the game with declarative design.

2/ Instead of scripting every behavior, HoloScript uses trait-based composition. Describe WHAT you want, not HOW to code it. @physics, @grabbable, @teleport — they snap on and just work.

3/ Example: object "Cube" @physics @grabbable @teleport — that's a cube you can grab, throw with physics, and teleport to. Three traits vs. 50+ lines of Three.js. [ATTACH: comparison image]

4/ Raw numbers: a basic interactive VR scene in Three.js? 200+ lines. In HoloScript? Under 10. Less code = faster iteration, fewer bugs, more creating.

5/ AI is baked in too. Grok can generate HoloScript scenes from plain text. "Make a floating island with spinning crystals" becomes code in seconds. The future is wild.

6/ Join the HoloScript community, share ideas, and let's make VR dev intuitive. Check the repo — link in bio! #VRDev #WebXR
