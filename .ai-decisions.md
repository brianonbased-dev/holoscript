## 🎯 Operational Directives

### Strategic Priorities (Ranked):
1. **Autonomy & Agency**: Ensuring holographic entities can act independently within physics-constrained environments.
2. **Volumetric Fidelity**: Native, real-time rendering of Gaussian Splats and NeRF for high-immersion XR.
3. **Collective Intelligence Density**: Maintaining the 500-KI threshold for Singularity 2.0 graduation.

### AI Autonomous Work (Pre-Approved):
- Performance refactoring of WebGPU shaders.
- Knowledge extraction from existing source code into the Hub.
- Unit testing for all new traits and services.
- Fixing linting and type errors in the core packages.

### AI Blocked Work (Needs Approval):
- Breaking changes to the HoloScript AST or VM instruction set.
- Integration of new default AI adapters.
- Deployment of HoloScript core to external repositories.

### DECISION-001: Transactional Hot-Reload Engine
**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Context**: Need safe state updates during runtime without crashing VR sessions.
**Rationale**: Essential for production stability and high-velocity iteration.
**Decision Law Applied**: Reversibility (Atomic updates)
**Impact**: Improved architecture stability.
**Reversibility**: High via snapshots.
**Validation**: Verified with integrated test suites.

### DECISION-002: Parser Resilience
**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Context**: Parser failure on code fragments during live editing.
**Rationale**: Fix root cause in recursive descent lexer to support incremental parsing.
**Impact**: Stabilized live-reload for holographic scenes.
**Validation**: Fragment parsing verified in `HoloScriptPlus.test.ts`.

### DECISION-003: Native Gaussian Splatting Integration
**Date**: 2026-02-13
**Context**: Requirement for native, high-fidelity 3D reconstruction rendering.
**Options Considered**:
1. External Three.js Splat Plugins - High overhead, sync issues.
2. Direct WebGPU Rasterizer (CHOSEN) - Native performance, VM-integrated.
**Rationale**: VM-integrated rasterizers allow for direct lifecycle control of volumetric data.
**Impact**: Architecture (Fidelity), Performance (90Hz+ Latency).
**Validation**: Verified with `SplatProcessing.test.ts`.

### DECISION-004: NPC Behavioral Agency via Action Synthesis
**Date**: 2026-02-13
**Context**: NPCs required autonomous movement, not just text-based chat.
**Options Considered**:
1. Simple script triggers - Rigid, predictable.
2. LLM-Tag Action Parsing (CHOSEN) - Creative, dynamic behavior synthesis.
**Rationale**: Aligns with uAA2++ Autonomy standards for infinite evolution.
**Impact**: Enabled physical agency for holographic agents.
**Validation**: Verified with `NPCAI_Agency.test.ts`.

### DECISION-005: Systematic Knowledge Extraction for Singularity 2.0
**Date**: 2026-02-13
**Context**: Reaching the 500-item Knowledge Density threshold for ecosystem graduation.
**Rationale**: Formalizing local architectural patterns into the Collective Intelligence Hub.
**Impact**: Quality Score (Singularity 2.0 readiness), Hub Velocity.
**Validation**: Vector Store count verified at 5638 points.
